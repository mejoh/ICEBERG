   Custom denoising pipeline. Motion parameters (with derivatives
   and expansions) are taken, as usual. Components from aCompCor and
   tCompCor are taken to account for cardiac and respiratory noise (50% cumulative variance explained). Because
   of the xCompCor components, cosines should normally be used as regressors as well,
   but we cant to take advantage of bandpass filtering in XCP-D, so we do not include
   them here. Lastly, ICA-AROMA components labelled as noise,
   but orthogonalized with respect to non-noise components, are included.
