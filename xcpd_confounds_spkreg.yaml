   Custom denoising pipeline. CSF, WM, and motion parameters (with derivatives
   and expansions) are taken, as usual. 5 components each from aCompCor and
   tCompCor are taken to account for cardiac and respiratory noise. Because
   of the xCompCor components, cosines should normally be used as regressors as well,
   but we cant to take advantage of bandpass filtering in XCP-D, so we do not include
   them here. Lastly, ICA-AROMA components labelled as noise,
   but orthogonalized with respect to non-noise components, are included.
